# `deobf`
Deobfuscator targetting `j*v*scr*pt-*bf*sc*t*r@3.2.1`
## DISCLAIMER
This is a hacky project I made over a week, then amended in my spare time. This is a messy exercise in AST analysis and transformations, while also being my first node.js project.
I have achieved source recovery with some small samples, however I wouldn't trust any output to be 1:1 with larger inputs, let alone executable or semantically identical.
For the most part, the output is meant to be a supplement to reverse-engineering the original sample. 
Use at your own peril.

Phishing pages bad, also npm malz lol
